In this project, we applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany.These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
The data used in this project has been provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

For this reason, the data used for this project was not uploaded to this repository.

## Requirements
The project needs the following libraries in the Anaconda distribution to run:

- Pandas 1.0.3
- Matplotlib 2.2.2
- Seaborn 0.10.1
- Scikit Learn: 0.22.1
